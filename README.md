# Directions

For the first 5 functions, we'll be using the Open Weather API, [https://openweathermap.org/api?ref=public-apis], which you'll need to log into to use. Once you're logged in, access the docs for Current Weather Data, the only one you can use for free. Use that for reference to the following functions:

1. Write a function, `getTemp`, that takes in a city and gets and returns the temperature of that city converted to Fahrenheit.

2. Write a function, `getDesc`, that takes in a city and gets and returns the description of the weather in that city.

3. Write a function, `getSun`, that returns the sunrise and the sunset from a city of your choice.

4. Write a function, `feelsLike`, that returns the city name of your choice, followed by the temperature it feels like, formatted
like so: (city): feels like (feels-like)

5. Write a function, `windAndCloudInfo`, that returns the wind speed and the amount of clouds in the sky. Format it in a sentence
of your choosing, make it yours!

For the next 3 functions, we'll be using the RecipePuppy API, [http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/?ref=public-apis]. Take a look at the example link they provide, and use it as reference.

6. Write a function, `recipeTitle`, that takes in an ingredient and returns the title of 5 recipes.

7. Write a function, `viewRecipe`, that takes two ingredients and returns the title of the recipe and the link to the source of the recipe.

8. Write a function, `prepping`, that takes two ingredients and returns the title of the recipe, and the ingredients they'll need. For example: 'The recipe is Mac and Cheese. You'll need pasta, cheese, etc.'
